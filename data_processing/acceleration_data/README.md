# Acceleration data

This is the benchmarked acceleration of the sphere in dipole tests.

The acceleration is needed to calculate the amplitude of oscillation of the sphere and subsequently the flow velocity at the tip of the whisker.

In each data file, the first column is the audio volume in Windows, the second column is the measured acceleration (in g).

Different gains were used for different dipole frequencies.
